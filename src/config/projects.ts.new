    fullDescription: 'This proposal outlines the development of an AI-powered personality assessment tool designed to enhance HR decision-making. Traditional personality assessments are often time-consuming and subject to human bias. Our solution integrates advanced machine learning models with modern UI/UX principles to streamline the evaluation process. Over the past eight weeks, we have conducted extensive research, gathered user feedback, and implemented AI-driven text extraction and analysis using Florence-2, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and the Deepseek API. The expected impact of this solution is improved efficiency, accuracy, and user experience in HR assessment processes.',

    fullDescription: 'In this project, we chose to use Amazon Athena and QuickSight as the main technologies to perform large-scale movie data analysis from the IMDb dataset. Our goal was to explore patterns in movie ratings, genres, directors, and production timelines using a serverless and scalable solution. We selected Athena because it allowed us to query data directly from Amazon S3 without building a complicated ETL pipeline. This greatly simplified the data transformation process and significantly reduced setup time. With Athena's pay-per-query model, we were also able to control costs effectively. Additionally, QuickSight was chosen for data visualization due to its seamless integration with Athena, allowing us to create interactive dashboards in real-time.',

    fullDescription: 'As part of an antenna design project under the guidance of Professor Gao Ju, I researched and analyzed the structure and electromagnetic behavior of Planar Inverted F-shaped Antennas (PIFA), widely used in mobile communications. I designed and simulated a single-frequency PIFA model in CST Microwave Studio targeting the Bluetooth frequency band. The final design achieved a center frequency of 2.45 GHz, return loss below -10 dB within the Bluetooth band, and input impedance matched to 50Ω — ensuring efficient performance for wireless applications. The project involved parameter sweeps and analysis of structural effects on resonant frequency.',
